# dropin-geometry

The idea of `dropin-geometry` is to provide 2d geometry functions for drawing libraries that lack all of those functions.

However, there are lots of geometry libraries out there so there is really no need for it. It's a better idea to take existing geometry libraries and add the dropin functionality into them.
